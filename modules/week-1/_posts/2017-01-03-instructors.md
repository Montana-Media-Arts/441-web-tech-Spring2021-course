Quick links, including email links, office hours, and lab hours, are all available from the ["Instructors"]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/) tab above in the course menubar.

What follows is a more detailed introduction to the people delivering this class to you this semester. We are a team, and will be working together to deliver this experience to you.


## Michael Cassens

I am the professor who is now delivering this course. I am also the instructor of record for this course. If you have any significant problems, administrative or technical, you will need to come to me about them.

I am excited to work with you, and guide you through the journey of beginning to code!

Please feel free to leverage my office hours. I would love it if each and everyone of you who are in Missoula could come by sometime in the first few weeks to introduce yourself. For those of you who are distance learners, please consider sending me an email about yourself, along with something to help me get to know you better, like your own website, or links to your creative work.  You are also welcome to set up a Zoom meeting with me and we can get to know one another better that way as well.

I would also like to say that I am first and foremost a teacher, so I will work to respond to your questions and problems as quickly as I can. E-mail is the second best way to get a hold of me. I will check my e-mail multiple times a day. My office hours are another way to get help from me. They are posted and updated in the ["Instructors"]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/) tab of this website.

## Teaching Assistant - TBA

We will have a Teaching Assistant. When this person contact is available, I will email the class. I will also post their information in the ["Instructors"]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/) tab.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course "issues forum" (more to come on that later), you should e-mail the TA for help.
