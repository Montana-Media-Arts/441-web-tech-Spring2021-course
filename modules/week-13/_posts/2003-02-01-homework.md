# Homework

In this homework, you are going to create a simple threejs project.  Create shapes, have them rotate, add one of your models, add text, lines, etc.  Be creative and have fun if you want to build off another project that is okay too.

1. Have at least two shapes on your screen.
2. Incorporate a model of yours onto the screen.
3. Have the shapes/models rotating around or moved based on the mouse (you will have to search for that one.)
4. Upload everything to your GitHub repository and turn your link into Moodle.
5. Have fun with this!
