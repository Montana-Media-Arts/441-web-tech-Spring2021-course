# threejs Install



First, go to [threejs.org](https://threejs.org/) and download the library. [Download here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/archive/master.zip)  From there, know that you need a live server to make this work. You can get this as an add-on in Atom and Visual Studio Code or Atom.  I won't run correctly otherwise.

## Live Server Instructions

Don't forget to create a js or library folder to hold your threejs file.  You can find the file you need in the **build** folder after you unzip the file.
