# Homework

In this homework assignment, you are going to create a virtual "ViewMaster" viewer.  It's up to you what you use as pictures, but it should contain not only the image but also the name of the photograph, a short description, the author of the image, and the date taken.  

You are going to create a single class and you will create multiple objects from this class.  Each time the button is pressed, a new image, title, description, author, and year should appear.  

You should store all your objects in an array, and you should pick a random object from your collection to display.

Whew! That sounds like a lot. Let's break it down.

## Technical Specs

1. Create a single class
2. Create at least five different objects from that class with the following properties:
   1. Title
   2. Image
   3. Description
   4. Author
   5. Image Year - make it up if you don't know
3. Store each object in a single array.
4. Have a button on the page
5. Pressing the button should randomly display an object from the array.
