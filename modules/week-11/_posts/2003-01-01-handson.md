So, typically we have a lot of hands-on work here, but I tried to incorporate it throughout the week as a new experiment. However, I will give you a space to experiment here and some tasks, so you have a place for extra practice.

<div id="jotted-demo-1" class="jotted-theme-stacked"></div>

<script>
    new Jotted(document.querySelector("#jotted-demo-1"), {
    files: [
        {
            type: "js",
            hide: false,
            url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Montana-Media-Arts/441-WebTech-Spring2019/master/Week%2011%20Examples/handsonscript.js"
        },
        {
            type: "html",
            hide: false,
            url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Montana-Media-Arts/441-WebTech-Spring2019/master/Week%2011%20Examples/HandsOnExample.html"

    }],
    showBlank: false,
    showResult: true,
    runScripts: true,
    plugins: [
        { name: 'ace', options: { "maxLines": 100, "Lines": 100 } },
        // { name: 'console', options: { autoClear: true } },
    ]
});
</script>
