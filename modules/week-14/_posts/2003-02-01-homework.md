# Homework

For this homework, you are going to create a node.js server and a simple client application.  Create a client application that takes in data from the user, write the information to a file, and then allows the user to go to another page to display the information that was stored in the file. Start the node.js server and then access the web application by typing in the URL.

1.	Install node.js.
2.	Experiment with callbacks, streams and the file system to create a web application that allows you to insert some data from the user.
3.	Once the information is gathered, write the information to a file.
4.	Allow the user to go to another page where the data read from the file and displayed.
5.	Write a short paper (1/2 page) on your experience.  How does node.js fit into everything that we have done this semester?
6. Submit everything into your repository and submit your link to Moodle.
